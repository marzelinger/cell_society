The XML files used to test this project are the following: 
1. fire_test1.xml
2. game_test1.xml
3. segregation_test1.xml
4. wator_test1.xml

It was found that out of all of the given simulations, the parameters for each simulation are all similar to each other and could be 
encompassed by only three variables: probability of actor ("probability empty"), probability of type of actor ("probability"), 
and one more simulator specific parameter that is called "threshold" that has the threshold or breeding time parameter.
